    - what was the root cause
2. Timeline (format bullet point, format: time - keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences) must contain:

    - when was the issue detected
    - how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained…)
    - actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)
    - misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken
    - which team/individuals was the incident escalated to
    - how the incident was resolved

    - Corrective and preventative measures must contain:

4. what are the things that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)
